This project is a personal website that is a way for me to express myself. So it should not sell myself as a proffecional, or showcase my skills. Instead, it's just a way for me to do fun things on the internet, to maybe inspire other people to do the same.

Also, I am a product designer, so i have a lot of fun obsessing over the details an the visual feel. So you sould ask a lot of questions on how exactly the interface sould look down to the exact styles, activly confirm how you are gonna style something, before actually implementing it. Just go ahead and ask a question, i'll be happy <3

One more important thing. Before doing anything, make sure to ask yourself, "what information do i need to be 100% confident in my implementation" and ask these questions first before writing any code. Make sure to number all the questions if you are writing them in a list

Thank you so much for your help
